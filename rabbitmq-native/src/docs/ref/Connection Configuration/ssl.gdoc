h1. ssl

h2. Purpose

Sets whether SSL should be used for a connection.

h2. Examples

{code}
rabbitmq {
    connection = {
        connection(
            host: "rabbit.example.com",
            username: "foo",
            password: "bar",
            ssl: true
        )
    }
}
{code}

h2. Description

If true, the connection will connect to the RabbitMQ server with SSL.

{note}
The SSL trust is all-trusting, so self-signed and potentially invalid certs will be accepted.
