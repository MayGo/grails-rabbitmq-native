The plugin expects the connection configuration to the RabbitMQ server to be defined. A bare minimum configuration example looks like:

{code}
rabbitmq {
    connection = {
        connection host: "example.com", username: "foo", password: "bar"
    }
}
{code}

Connections to many different RabbitMQ servers can be configured.  A multi-server configuration looks like:

{code}
rabbitmq {
    connection = {
        connection host: "rabbit1.example.com", username: "foo", password: "bar"
        connection host: "rabbit2.example.com", username: "foo", password: "bar"
    }
}
{code}

The following table enumerates all the configuration options available to the connection configuration:
